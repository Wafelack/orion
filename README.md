### MacOS, BSD and GNU/Linux

You will need: the Rust toolchain (1.50+), a "make" program, a POSIX shell (installed in `/bin/sh`) and Git.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wafelack/orion.git
$ cd orion/
$ chmod +x configure
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

### Windows

* Clone the project.
* Build with cargo.
* Copy `target/release/orion` to `C:/Program Files/Orion`.
* Copy `lib/` to `C:/Program Files/Orion/`.
* Add `C:/Program Files/Orion` to your `PATH`.

Roadmap
-------

- [x] Lexing
- [x] Parsing
- [x] Evaluation
- [x] Core functionnality
- [ ] Standard library.

Differences between Orion and Orion++
-------------------------------------

Orion++ is purely functional, has enums, tuples, pattern matching, and a tiny builtin part.
Orion is functional and imperative, has mutation, and an enormous builtin part.

Performances
------------

Speed is not Orion's main goal, but here are some benchmarks.

### Ackermann p√©ter function - m := 3 ; n := 3 - 500 runs
