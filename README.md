Features
--------

- Lightness: Orion source code fits under 3k SLOC and its binary is under 2MB.
- Portable: Orion code is run on a virtual machine, that avoids architecture-specific problems.
- Purely functional: Pattern matching, immutability, side effects control.
- Elegant: It embeds shorthands such as `'<expr>` for `(\ () <expr>)` or `{ <expr>* }` for `(begin <expr>*)`.


Installation
------------

### MacOS, BSD and GNU/Linux

You will need: the Rust toolchain (1.50+), a "make" program, a POSIX shell (installed in `/bin/sh`) and Git.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/orion-lang/orion.git
$ cd orion/
$ chmod +x configure
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install PREFIX==/wherever/you/want/
```

### Windows

Build the project, copy the binary to your path, move the library wherever you want and set `ORION_LIB` to this location.

Documentation
-------------

You can find the standard library, the core and the builtins documentation [here](docs/).

Quick Example
-------------

Factorial function:

```clojure
(def factorial (λ (n)
                    (match n
                        (0 1)
                        (_ (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))))
```
